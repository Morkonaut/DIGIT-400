# Gamesave.online

GameSave.Online was designed to aid PC gamers in their search for the best PC game prices across the web. Conglomerating deals from Steam and Green Man Gaming using Pythonic web scraping, GameSave.Online allows you to compare game deals from these two virtual retailers without having to visit them individually.

The original scope of the project was meant to compare deals across Steam, The Humble Store, GOG.com, and Green Man Gaming, however, due to some unforseen issues with The Humble Store site and GOG.com, they aren't included in the final product.
